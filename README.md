## Welcome to Jieyi (Chloe) Chen's GitHub Pages

About Me:

Jieyi (Chloe) Chen is currently pursuing a B.S. degree in Statistics and Managerial Economics at University of California, Davis. She would like to pursue a career in data science because she believes that any business decisions should be supported by data. In the future, she hopes to get the "sexiest job of the 21st century" where she can apply the statistical models and programming skills to find the trend and make forecast.
