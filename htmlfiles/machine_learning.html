	<h2><strong><a name="Introduction"><span style="color: green">Introduction</span></a></strong></h2>
	<p> This page contains the projects that I have worked on in the machine learning course. I gained a deep understanding of different machine learning models through the application to the real-world datasets. <p>

	
	<h2><strong><a name = "p1" href = "../Projects/Linear & Logistic Regression.pdf"> <span style = "color: green"> Project I - Linear & Logistic Regression </span></a></strong></h2>

	<p> Investigate the relationship between the miles per gallon (mpg) and several features of a car using linear and logistic regression. <a href = "https://github.com/chloechen1995/machine_learning_projects/blob/master/Linear%20%26%20Logistic%20Regression.ipynb"> [Code] <a><p>

	<h2><strong><a name = "p2" href = "../Projects/Artificial Neural Network Classifier.pdf"> <span style = "color: green"> Project II - Artificial Neural Network Classifier </span></a></strong></h2>

	<p> Build a neural network classifier that can find the localization site of a protein in yeast based on different features. <a href = "https://github.com/chloechen1995/machine_learning_projects/blob/master/Artificial%20Neural%20Network%20Classifier.ipynb"> [Code] <a><p>

	<h2><strong><a name = "p3" href = "../Projects/SVM_PCA.pdf"> <span style = "color: green"> Project III - Regularization & Bootstrapping & Support Vector Machine & Principal Component Analysis </span></a></strong></h2>

	<p> <li> Use regularization methods to select the informative features. </li>
		<li> Calculate the confidence interval of the prediction using the bootstrapping method. </li>
		<li> Create Support Vector Machine Classifier and evaluate its performance using ROC (Receiver Operating Characteristic) and PR (Precision â€“ Recall) Curve. </li>
		<li> Perform Principal Component Analysis and evaluate its performance using ROC and PR Curve. </li>
